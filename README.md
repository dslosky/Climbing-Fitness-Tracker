# Climbing-Fitness-Tracker
Training records shouldn't be left in a notebook to slowly fade and be forgotten. When you finally send your proj, you should be able to look back teary eyed and bloody knuckled at your hard work that brought you here. And I'm not talking about the chalk covered pages scribbled on in your barely legible scrawl; I'm talking about graphs. Data. BIG data. HUGE DATA. Imagine an application that lets you plan climbing-specific workouts, record your results, and analyze your progress. With a data-backed training regimen  you'll be sending Lucid Dreaming in no time.

I created this application for two reasons: One, I had just landed a job as a web developer and needed to develop my skills FAST. And two, I honestly couldn't believe it didn't exist already.
